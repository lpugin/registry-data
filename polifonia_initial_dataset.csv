MD,The Global Jukebox,"The heart of this project is rooted in a lifetime of song research by Alan Lomax (1915-2002). Over his long life he recorded music and interviews with folk musicians throughout the Western Hemisphere. He spent the 1950s based in London, where he assembled a multi-volume collection of ""folk and primitive"" music for Columbia Records. (His relocation enabled Lomax to escape the brunt of McCarthyite discrimination against prominent figures from the music world–including Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein. He was at various points under surveillance by Britain's MI5 and, in the US, by the CIA and the FBI. No charges were ever brought.) features and their incidence in a series of pieces representing Hunedoara culture,"">Roumania in The Global Jukebox. In 2012 the Library of Congress agreed to make his 5,000 hours of sound recordings, 400,000 feet of film, 3,000 videotapes, and 5,000 photographs available for The Global Jukebox. Lomax has devoted the last two decades of his life to this project. In its current state the website has significant debts to long-time associates including Lomax's daughter Anna Lomax Wood and a team of specialists who provided technical support. Using geospatial data The Global Jukebox will enable you to explore these recordings by place and by many other parameters. It is the first open-access evidence of this decades-long collection development. Under the auspices of the Association for Cultural Equity, which Lomaz founded, current researchers welcome contributions of metadata, especially song titles. An earlier collection of his work (1937) is housed at the University of Kentucky. It was Lomax's intention to implement his work in cantometrics (1959) and choreometrics in a computer system (initiated by the musicologist Victor Grauer). Considering that 37 criteria were used for the initial version of the system, the system was highly ambitious. The richness of the detail is captured in the image above, which displays metadata, content description, rate of occurrence, and musical texture in a series of Roumanian songs. Choreometrics was pursued in collaboration with Irmgard Bartenieff and Forrestine Paulay, who were also involved in the development of Laban Notation. The implementation of choreometrics at this website accommodates 119 variables.",http://theglobaljukebox.org/gjb-map.html#,The Global Jukebox,Digital Resources for Musicology,,,,Dataset,Media,Y,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,,Track,Audio,Y,Open Access,Free,Y,Y,N/A,,N,N,N,Y,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,music listening; data visualization,amateurs

ED,Chopin First Editions Online,Collection and digital edition of Chopin's works,http://www.chopinonline.ac.uk/,Mellon Foundation grant,MuSO (Europeana)," What is a musical ‘work’, and how is the ‘work concept’ that has prevailed since the midnineteenth century challenged by the Chopin sources?
 What is the best means of capturing in an edition the creative history implicit in the sources, ranging from the earliest sketches through to the last impressions of the first editions and beyond?
 How can the intellectual and logistical difficulties routinely experienced by editors in handling disparate source materials be overcome by means of technological support?
 In what ways might technology change the mode of presenting information previously contained within – or, conversely, uncontainable within – printed editions? Moreover, how might technology fundamentally alter the musician’s and the musicologist’s understanding of individual sources, their often complex interrelationships, and their significance as artistic and cultural artifacts within a rich history of publication, pedagogy, and performance? 
The main outcomes of the OCVE project are as follows:
 An online musical edition demonstrating the ways in which scholarship and technology can interact to mutual advantage
 An interlinked archive of digitised manuscript and printed sources of a large body of music, all of which can be displayed in various formats
 Detailed philological descriptions written by the scholarly team
 Personal annotation tools allowing individual users to create their own virtual OCVE with personal comments at several levels of granularity, and picklists of scores or works which persist between access sessions.
The main outcomes of the CFEO project are as follows:
 An important body of primary source material has been comprehensively assembled for the first time, facilitating philological and stylehistorical investigation and encouraging new understanding of Chopin’s compositional and publication histories.
 The Online Collection – totalling some 270 scores – provides direct access to musicians and musicologists to the Chopin first editions.
 The textanalytical commentary and online catalogue excerpts foreground the major differences between multiple first editions and their chronological and filial relationships.
 The technical outcomes are generalisable to similar projects of a musical and/or nonmusical nature and to other initiatives.",http://www.chopinonline.ac.uk/cfeo/browse/pageview/63082/,,Repository,Metadata,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,JPG,Score,Score,Y,Not specified,Free,Y,Y,N/A,,N/A,N/A,N,Y,<100000,~Gb,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,data visualization; image annotation,researchers

MD,Tudor Partbooks,"This collaboration between the Universities of Oxford and Newcastle (funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council) aims to restore and make available online all extant manuscripts of Tudor polyphonic music from c.1510-1590 preserved in partbook format. Its particular focus is on the manuscript copies (and their legacies) of John Sadler (1513-c. 1591/2), John Baldwin (1560-1615), and their predecessors. Researchers from Oxford (Kathryn Butler, Julia Craig-McFeely) and Newcastle (Magnus Williamson, Daisy Gibbs) will rely on contributions from volunteers to help develop the virtual resources. Technical challenges include Tudor reliance on high-acid inks and their detrimental effects on physical preservation of their copies. Digital tools are employed to restore lost elements of the physical sources. A principal Church Oxford source of the Baldwin partbooks is described in DIAMM, with further details in the Christ Church overview.

MD,Music Encoding and Linked Data (MELD),"The MELD framework and implementation architecture augments and extends MEI structures with semantic Web Annotations capable of addressing musically meaningful score sections. Through its use of Linked Data, MELD deploys knowledge structures expressing relationships unconstrained by boundaries of the encoding schema, musical sub-domain, or use case context, supporting retrieval of a wide range of music information. Within the framework, music-generic structures are linked with, but separable from, components expressing domain-specific entities associated with concrete instantiations of musical segments. By use of the flexible and extensible Web Annotation model, new kinds of annotations are easily incorporated through customisation of the MELD JavaScript web-client via drop-in rendering and interaction handlers. Annotation can seamlessly reference external data sources, and can in turn be referenced for external analysis, reuse, and repurposing in other contexts.",https://github.com/oerc-music/meld,Music Encoding and Linked Data (MELD),Music scores,,,Music Ontology; MEI XML schema,Software,Symbolic,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,"RDF, MEI/XML, Python",Score,Score,Y,Open Access,Free,Y,Y,N,,N/A,N,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,N,N,Y,Y,music history; musicology; music information retrieval; music annotation,researchers
